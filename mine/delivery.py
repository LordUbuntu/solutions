# Jacobus Burger (2023)
# Problem:
#   You've been given a stack of coloured papers/towels that need to be
#   delivered to color-coded recepticles that match their colour, but
#   the pile is not in order, and you don't have time to sort the pile
#   or revisit any bins on your linear path. Find a way to get all the
#   items to their correct destination without revisiting!
#   You can only add and remove items from the top of the pile.
#   You cannot return to a previously visited bin.
#   You must not have any leftovers when you reach the end of the run.
