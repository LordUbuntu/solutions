# Solutions

## Description

Welcome to "Solutions", a collection of various programming problems and the various solutions I came to, documented along with the process for solving those problems. I created this repository to document and express the problem solving process, practice communicating that process, etc. This might exist for a short while or I may keep it up indefinitely. In any case, I hope it helps anyone trying to figure out the process and get an idea for how to solve problems. If there is one skill that will never go out of fashion, it is problem solving.

I want this information to be a supplement to aid in learning. So please don't copy this work and claim it as your own. Please don't substitute it for your own solutions either. The goal and joy of all programming and problem solving is to challenge ourselves and grow.

## Structure

Each problem is contained in a folder named after the problem name. Within these folders are the source code in one (or more) languages, along with a markdown file detailing and explaining the problem and solution.

All problem folders are contained within a folder named after the source website (where the problem was gotten from).
